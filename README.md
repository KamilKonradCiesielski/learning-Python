# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning Python. Here I switch from Embedded C to high-level scripting, focusing on logic, data structures, and clean code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Focus:** Logic exercises, Algorithms, Automation scripts

## 📁 Projects Directory

Each folder contains a standalone Python script and its documentation.

1. **[Rock Paper Scissors](./01_Rock_Paper_Scissors)** - terminal-based game practicing functions, loops, and the `random` module.
2. **[Blackjack CLI](./02_Blackjack_CLI)** - terminal-based card game featuring automated dealer logic. This project focuses on managing state with lists and dictionaries, complex loop nesting, and input validation.
3. **[Caesar's Cipher](./03_Caesar's_Cipher)** - terminal-based encryption tool that applies the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. This project focuses on character-to-number mapping using ASCII standards and procedural logic flow.
4. **[Cho-Han CLI](./04_Cho-Han_CLI)** - terminal-based game that simulates the traditional Japanese game of Cho-Han, allowing a player to bet on whether the sum of two randomly rolled dice will be even or odd over a specified number of rounds.
