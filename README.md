# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning Python. Here I switch from Embedded C to high-level scripting, focusing on logic, data structures, and clean code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Focus:** Logic exercises, Algorithms, Automation scripts

## 📁 Projects Directory

Each folder contains a standalone Python script and its documentation.

1. **[Rock Paper Scissors](./01_Rock_Paper_Scissors)** - A terminal-based game practicing functions, loops, and the `random` module.
2. *(Coming soon...)* - Next logic exercise.

### 🎮 Project Details: Rock Paper Scissors
Specifically, this first project covers:
* **Function definitions** for modular code.
* **While loops** with complex exit conditions.
* **Input validation** (using `.lower()` to handle user typos).
* **Randomization** to simulate computer AI.
